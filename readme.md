# Feedr

**Feedr** is a personalized feed reader, it pulls feeds from our favorite blogs.
The user will be able to filter between publications through the dropdown on the header menu.
Clicking/tapping on one of the articles will load a pop up with more
information. The user from that point will be able to either dismiss the
additional information or go to the referenced article.

This is a single page app. All of our application views are
contained in the [index.html](index.html) file. The feeds are pulled from
respective feed APIs, the content is changed by toggling appropriate classes based on site architecture.
